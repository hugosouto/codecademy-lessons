# The output should look like this:

# Here's what our room looks like:
# 
# Person 1's birthday: November 27
# Person 2's birthday: July 28
# 
# The probability that two people in a room of 2 people have the same birthday is nearly 0.27%
# 
# In our simulation, no two people have the same birthday
